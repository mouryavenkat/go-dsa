Go Build Flags

gcflags="-d pctab=pctofile" -> (This determines all the Low level registers that program required. It also shows the inlined functions and their reference)

gcflags="-m" -> This specified which functions are inlined and which variables escaped to the heap

gcflags="-m -m" -> This prints more verbose output detailing the information of `gcflags="-m"`

gcflags="-l" -> This flag makes sure that the build doesn't inline any function
